This project implements matrix multiplication using RISC-V assembly. It performs multiplication of two matrices and stores the result efficiently.
To run this code you need to download "ripes" simulator.
The code does matrix multiplication for predefined matrices, A and B and the code gives output AB


A = [[11  12  23]
      [13  6  34]]
and

B=[[10  11]
    [14 16]
    [23  17]]
